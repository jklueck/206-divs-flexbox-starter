            <h2>A universe-spanning tale about humankind.</h2>
            <p>Humans exist on nearly every habitable planet throughout the Known Universe. They exist and thrive because they are the most efficient manifestations of intelligence and matter, but they are not alone.</p>

                In the year 2097, much of the world was under the control of the United Government of Earth. The UGeo, as it was commonly called, came to power during the upheaval that followed a landmark breakthrough in energy production known as 'hydrogen stripping.'
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                Due to its low energy input, the phenomenon had been dismissed by individual teams as an error for decades. In short, the data suggested it was possible to create a 'cold fission' reaction that would strip single protons from heavy metal atoms to form new hydrogen atoms.
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                This meant that it was possible to reduce garbage into pure energy by using the abundance of hydrogen to create powerful fuel cells. The project required enormous investment and coordination of international space agencies to capture, but lifted the standard of living across the world.
